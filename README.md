# Tekium PAN Hunter Script v1.1.3

It's a tool that can be used to search drives for credit card numbers (PANs). This is useful for checking PCI DSS scope accuracy.

Born from the need to have a tool that is easy to run and use. Ideal if you need a tool that looks for possible PAN's on your organization.

# Characteristics
- Search for VISA, AMEX and MASTER CARD card numbers (based on regular expressions)
- Shows the first five matches of each file
- Masks the first 12 characters of the card number, for security reasons
- Generates a log file with the search results
- Shows the progress of the search on the screen
- Validate the possible PAN using the [Luhn algorithm](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algoritmo_de_Luhn)

# Requirements for Windows Systems
- Windows operating system
- PowerShell (A recent version is recommended)
- PowerShell Console (Executed with administrator permissions)
- Script execution enabled (Otherwise, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`)

# Requirements for Linux Systems

```
usage: ./Tekium_PAN_Hunter_Script.ps1 [-search_path] [-filters] [-exclude_path]

optional arguments:
  -search_path       Path where the possible PANs will be searched (default: C:\)
  -filters       Extensions of the files to be searched (default: '*.txt','*.csv','*.log')
  -exclude_path       Path or paths that are excluded from the search
```

By default, the script looks in C:\ and files with the extension .txt, .csv, and .log. 

This can be changed using the parameters: "search_path", where the path where the search will be performed (recursively) is indicated. The other is "filters" where the file types where the PANs will be searched are indicated, these must be specified as follows: ‚Äò*.txt‚Äô, ‚Äò*.docx‚Äô, ‚Äò*.xml‚Äô (separated by commas). The "exclude_path" parameter is optional and should only be used if you need to exclude certain directories or folders from the search. These paths must be specified as follows: "C:\Windows", "C:\Program and Files" (separated by commas).

For example:

`.\Tekium_PAN_Hunter_Script.ps1 -search_path ‚ÄúC:\Users‚Äù -filters ‚Äò*.log‚Äô, ‚Äò*.txt‚Äô, ‚Äò*.csv‚Äô, ‚Äò*.docx‚Äô, ‚Äò*.xlsx‚Äô, ‚Äò*.xls‚Äô, ‚Äò*.doc‚Äô -exclude_path "C:\Users\Downloads"`

# Running on Linux systems

Give execution permissions to the file "Tekium_PAN_Hunter_Script.sh", for this the following command is executed:

`chmod +x Tekium_PAN_Hunter_Script.sh`

By default, the script looks in files with the extension: txt, csv, docx, xlsx, xls, doc and log. 

You must indicate the path where the script will perform the search (recursively).

For example:

`.\Tekium_PAN_Hunter_Script.sh /home/user/Documents`
