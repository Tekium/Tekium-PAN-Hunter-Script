# Tekium PAN Hunter Script v1.1.4

It's a tool that can be used to search drives for credit card numbers (PANs). This is useful for checking PCI DSS scope accuracy.

Born from the need to have a tool that is easy to run and use. Ideal if you need a tool that looks for possible PAN's on your organization.

# Characteristics
- Search for VISA, AMEX and MASTER CARD card numbers (based on regular expressions)
- Shows the total number of possible PAN's per file
- Masks the first 12 characters of the card number, for security reasons
- Option to exclude specific directories or folders
- Generates a log file with the search results
- Shows the progress of the search on the screen
- Validate the possible PAN using the [Luhn algorithm](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algoritmo_de_Luhn)
- Obtains the hash of the file with the result (validate file integrity)

# Requirements for Windows Systems

usage: .\Tekium_PAN_Hunter_Script.ps1 [-search_path] [-filters] [-exclude_path]

optional arguments:
  -search_path       Path where the possible PANs will be searched (default: C:\)
  -filters       Extensions of the files to be searched (default: '*.txt','*.csv','*.log')
  -exclude_path       Path or paths that are excluded from the search
```

By default, the script looks in C:\ and files with the extension .txt, .csv, and .log. 

This can be changed using the parameters: "search_path", where the path where the search will be performed (recursively) is indicated. The other is "filters" where the file types where the PANs will be searched are indicated, these must be specified as follows: `‚Äò*.txt‚Äô, ‚Äò*.docx‚Äô, ‚Äò*.xml‚Äô` (separated by commas). The "exclude_path" parameter is optional and should only be used if you need to exclude certain directories or folders from the search. These paths must be specified as follows: `"C:\Windows", "C:\Program and Files"` (separated by commas).

For example:

`.\Tekium_PAN_Hunter_Script.ps1 -search_path ‚ÄúC:\Users‚Äù -filters ‚Äò*.log‚Äô, ‚Äò*.txt‚Äô, ‚Äò*.csv‚Äô, ‚Äò*.docx‚Äô, ‚Äò*.xlsx‚Äô, ‚Äò*.xls‚Äô, ‚Äò*.doc‚Äô -exclude_path "C:\Users\Downloads"`

This can be changed using the parameters: The first parameter indicates the path where the search will be performed (recursively). The second parameter indicates the types of files where the PANs will be searched, these must be specified as follows: `txt,docx,xml` (separated by commas). The third parameter is optional and should only be used if you need to exclude certain directories or folders from the search.
